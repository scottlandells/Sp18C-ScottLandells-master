	<h1>HI, MY NAME IS SCOTT LANDELLS!</h1>

	<!-- I noticed some grammar errors in the original About Me section. I hope I corrected them. -->
<br>
<section>
	<p>I am a graphic design student at Parkland College in Champaign, Illinois. I have experience working with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. My favorite designers are Saul Bass, Jason Munn and Art Chantry.</p>

	<p>I will graduate with an Associates Degree in the Spring of 2019. I have a Bachelors of Science Degree in Art from Illinois State University.</p>

	<p>When I am not designing, I like to fish, bicycle, swim and cook. My father and I go fishing every summer in Michigan. There is a poind connected to his backyard. When I am at his house, I love to wake up early in the morning, have a quick breakfast, and then go fishing all day. Large-mouth Bass are my favorite fresh-water fish to catch. Here is a list of fish I like to catch.</p> <q>Fishing in Michigan is the best!</q>
	<ul>
		<li>Large-Mouth Bass</li>
		<li>Blue Gill <strong>(Delicious!)</strong></li>
		<li>Sunfish</li>
		<li>Crappie <strong>(Very Delicious!)</strong></li>
	</ul>
		<p><cite>Michigan Fish and How to Catch Them </cite> by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources</p>

	<p>I am also passionate about volunterring in the community. I have volunteered at a local shelter, theatre and I like to help clean up our local fresh-water streams. I think giving back to the community is important. <em>Everyone should try it!</em></p>
