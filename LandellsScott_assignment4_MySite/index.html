		<h3>Work Experience</h3>
				<p>I have 20 years experice as a social worker in Champaign County. I have worked for the Men's Emergency Shelter, Urbana School District, Developmental Services Center and Rosecrance Behavioral Health.</p>
		<h3>Personal Interests</h3>
				<p>When I am not designing, I like to fish, bicycle, swim and cook. My father and I go fishing every summer in Michigan. There is a poind connected to his backyard. When I am at his house, I love to wake up early in the morning, have a quick breakfast, and then go fishing all day. Large-mouth Bass are my favorite fresh-water fish to catch. Here is a list of fish I like to catch. Fishing in Michigan is the best!</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Large-Mouth Bass<i lang="la" >   (Micropterus salmoides)</i></li>
						<li>Blue Gill <strong>(Delicious!)</strong></li>
						<li>Sunfish</li>
						<li>Crappie <strong>(Very Delicious!)</strong></li>
					</ul>

				<p>I am also passionate about volunterring in the community. I have volunteered at a local shelter, theatre and I like to help clean up our local fresh-water streams. I think giving back to the community is important. <em>Everyone should try it!</em></p>
